### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daiki, and it means "Great Trees."ðŸŒ³ Feel free to call me DK.
# About me
I'm from Kanazawa city, Ishikawa, and currently live in Tokyo. My partner works in Boulogne, France. I need a decent amount of nature, like forests and rivers.
I love swing music, rap, hamburgers, cooking, exploring art, and mentoring graduate students grow.
